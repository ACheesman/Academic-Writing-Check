Mark duplicate words, weasel words and passive voice in 
academic writing. Currently duplicate words are shown in yellow,
weasel words in green and passive voice in red, all at the same time!

Thanks to http://matt.might.net/articles/shell-scripts-for-passive-voice-weasel-words-duplicates/ for 
all the work

Ways to call the script :

./checkwriting <file> <file>...
cat <file> | ./checkwriting 
./checkwriting <directory_with_tex_files>

Command line arguments are --no-<option>, where option is one of : passive, weasel, dups, strunk, abbr.
Thus --no-abbr means the script won't look for abbreviation errors.

Note in the last case the search for tex files is not recursive and
if no .tex exists then script will wait for input from stdin

Some improvements compared to the original:
  * All 3 checks done at the same time and shown at the same time
  * Support for a directory as input
  * Support for checking passive voice across newlines
  * Support for STDIN if no filename specified
  * Ignore lines beginning with a %
