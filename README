Mark duplicate words, weasel words and passive voice in 
academic writing.

Thanks to http://matt.might.net/articles/shell-scripts-for-passive-voice-weasel-words-duplicates/ for 
all the work

Ways to call the script :

./checkwriting <file> <file>...
cat <file> | ./checkwriting 
./checkwriting <directory_with_tex_files>

Note in the last case the search for tex files is not recursive and
if no .tex exists then script will wait for input from stdin
